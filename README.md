# Transfer Learning 101

### How do I get set up? ###

1. Make sure you either:
  -- create a virtual environment
  -- or are running a docker container with docker ([see here](https//hub.docker.com/r/tensorflow/tensorflow/))
2. Install the dependencies with the `requirements.txt` in this repo.

Quick start:
```sh
$ virtualenv -p $(which python3) py-tf
$ source py-tf/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Both Python 2.7 and Python 3.5 should work (tested with 2.7 and 3.5). That said, it's time to let 2.7 go.

### Finding your way ###
`sh` is your entry point; there's a bash script to showcase the usage of the retraining code

`scripts` contains the retraining code; notice there have been some modifications to the original Tensorflow github script, 
but the interface is the same.

`tf_files` Just like in the original Tensorflow Transfer Learning [tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/image_retraining): data, models and logs will be saved here. 

#### Tensorboard ####
Notice tf_files/training_summaries contains the following structure:
   * architecture
      * training_timestamp
        * train
        * validation

This way you will be able to compare the loss function and other metrics from different trainings in the same Tensoboard
plot.

I'm redistributing modifications under the same Apache 2.0 license from the original Tensorflow code.
